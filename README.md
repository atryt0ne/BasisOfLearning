# README

The computer has been one of the most important scientific inventions, and yet the computer is largely considered dumb, incapable of learning, atleast until the past few decades.

Technologies like deep learning are here to change that, and to teach computers what humans are capable of doing naturally, to write novels, give quizzes, play games and what not.

In this project, we shall explore deep learning, FNN, PCA, GD, CNN, RNN, encoder-decoder models.

# Week 1 - Setup
The goal for this week is to learn the basics of Python, Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib and come up with guides to explain the same.
